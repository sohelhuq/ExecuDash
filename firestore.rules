/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for ExecuDash application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes secure data access based on ownership and group membership,
 * using path-based authorization and explicit ownership checks.  It assumes a strict
 * separation between user-specific data and shared data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - Business Unit data is stored under `/business_units/{businessUnitId}`.
 * - Metrics are stored under `/business_units/{businessUnitId}/metrics/{metricId}`.
 * - User dashboards are stored under `/users/{userId}/dashboards/{dashboardId}`.
 * - Widgets are stored under `/users/{userId}/dashboards/{dashboardId}/widgets/{widgetId}`.
 * - Alerts are stored under `/business_units/{businessUnitId}/alerts/{alertId}`.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only manage their own dashboards and widgets.
 * - Business Unit and Metric data is not editable through the client and read-only for the application (no rules provided).
 * - List operations on user-owned subcollections are allowed for the owner.
 * - No public listing of business units or alerts is allowed.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Authorization data (e.g., user roles, group memberships) should be denormalized
 *   onto the documents being secured to avoid costly `get()` calls in rules.
 *   For example, a `members` map on a dashboard document can grant access to specific users.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - User-specific data (dashboards, widgets) is segregated under `/users/{userId}` to
 *   simplify access control and prevent unintended data exposure.
