/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for ExecuDash and Bricks ERP.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes security by enforcing strict access control based on user roles and explicit relationships.
 * It allows for rapid prototyping by minimizing data shape validation but rigorously enforces authorization.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /employees/{employeeId}: Employee profiles, roles, and business unit access.
 * - /business_units/{businessUnitId}: Business unit information.
 * - /business_units/{businessUnitId}/metrics/{metricId}: Metrics for each business unit.
 * - /dashboards/{dashboardId}: Dashboard configurations.
 * - /dashboards/{dashboardId}/widgets/{widgetId}: Widgets for each dashboard.
 * - /business_units/{businessUnitId}/alerts/{alertId}: Alert configurations for each business unit.
 * - /raw_materials/{materialId}: Raw material information.
 * - /production_batches/{batchId}: Production batch data.
 * - /finished_goods/{goodId}: Finished goods inventory.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Employees can only read and write their own employee document.
 * - Listing employees is not permitted to prevent information disclosure.
 * - All other collections require authentication.
 * - No public data access is allowed without authentication.
