/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for ExecuDash application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user-specific data (dashboards) and allows public read access to business unit data while restricting writes to authorized users. Data required for authorization decisions is denormalized onto the documents being secured.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, accessible only by the user themselves.
 * - /users/{userId}/dashboards/{dashboardId}: Stores dashboards owned by a user, accessible only by that user.
 * - /business_units/{businessUnitId}: Stores business unit information, publicly readable but write-protected.
 * - /business_units/{businessUnitId}/metrics/{metricId}: Stores metrics related to business units, publicly readable but write-protected.
 * - /business_units/{businessUnitId}/widgets/{widgetId}: Stores widgets related to business units, publicly readable but write-protected.
 * - /business_units/{businessUnitId}/alerts/{alertId}: Stores alerts related to business units, publicly readable but write-protected.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - Business unit data is publicly readable to support QAPs.
 * - Write access to business unit data is denied to all users in this prototype.
 * - Default security posture for ambiguous relationships is strict owner-only access.
