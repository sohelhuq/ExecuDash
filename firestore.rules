/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for ExecuDash.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a role-based access control model, where access to data
 * is determined by the user's role and the business units they are authorized to access.
 * Users can only manage resources within the business units they are assigned to.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /employees/{employeeId}: Stores employee profiles, roles, and business unit access.
 * - /business_units/{businessUnitId}: Stores business unit information.
 * - /business_units/{businessUnitId}/metrics/{metricId}: Stores metrics for each business unit.
 * - /dashboards/{dashboardId}: Stores dashboard configurations.
 * - /dashboards/{dashboardId}/widgets/{widgetId}: Stores widgets for each dashboard.
 * - /business_units/{businessUnitId}/alerts/{alertId}: Stores alerts for each business unit.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Employs role-based access control using the 'role' field in the /employees collection.
 * - Enforces business unit-level access control using the 'businessUnitIds' field in the /employees collection.
 * - Denies listing of the /employees collection to prevent unauthorized enumeration of users.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The 'Employee' entity denormalizes 'role' and 'businessUnitIds' fields directly onto the document to avoid additional reads during authorization.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Private data (employee profiles) is stored in /employees/{employeeId}, separate from public data.
