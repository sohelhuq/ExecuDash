/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for ExecuDash and Bricks ERP.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes secure authorization based on user identity and role.
 * It aims to prevent unauthorized data access and modification while remaining flexible on data shapes.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /employees/{employeeId}: Stores employee profiles; employeeId must match the authenticated user's UID.
 * - /business_units/{businessUnitId}: Stores business unit information.
 * - /business_units/{businessUnitId}/metrics/{metricId}: Stores metrics associated with business units.
 * - /dashboards/{dashboardId}: Stores dashboard configurations.
 * - /dashboards/{dashboardId}/widgets/{widgetId}: Stores widgets associated with dashboards.
 * - /business_units/{businessUnitId}/alerts/{alertId}: Stores alert configurations for business units.
 * - /raw_materials/{materialId}: Stores raw material information for the bricks business.
 * - /production_batches/{batchId}: Stores production batch information for the bricks business.
 * - /finished_goods/{goodId}: Stores finished goods (bricks) information.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Employs strict owner-only access for employee profiles (employees/{employeeId}).
 * - Allows only authenticated users to manage business units.
 * - For the Bricks ERP module, allows only authenticated users to manage production, raw materials, and finished goods data.
