/**
 * @fileOverview This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user-specific data
 *   and a public-read, owner-write model for business unit data. It leverages path-based
 *   authorization to ensure that users can only access their own dashboards and that
 *   writes to business unit data are restricted.
 *
 * @dataStructure
 *   - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, with each document ID matching the user's UID.
 *   - /users/{userId}/dashboards/{dashboardId}: Stores dashboards owned by a specific user.
 *   - /business_units/{businessUnitId}: Stores business unit information.
 *   - /business_units/{businessUnitId}/metrics/{metricId}: Stores metrics for a business unit.
 *   - /business_units/{businessUnitId}/widgets/{widgetId}: Stores widgets for a business unit.
 *   - /business_units/{businessUnitId}/alerts/{alertId}: Stores alerts for a business unit.
 *
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 *   - Users can only read and write their own user documents and dashboards.
 *   - Listing of users is disallowed.
 *   - Business unit data is publicly readable, but only authorized users can create, update, or delete it.
 *   - The rules do not enforce strict schema validation beyond authorization-critical fields.
 *
 * @denormalizationForAuthorization Not applicable in this basic prototype.
 * @structuralSegregation User-specific data (dashboards) is segregated under the /users/{userId} collection.
