/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Prototyping.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes security and rapid iteration. It enforces
 * authentication and basic ownership but relaxes data validation to
 * allow for flexible schema changes during prototyping.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - `/attendance_points/{pointId}`: Stores attendance data. No ownership
 *   defined in schema.
 * - `/employees/{employeeId}`: Stores employee records. No ownership
 *   defined in schema.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Authentication is required for all operations.
 * - No user listing is allowed (explicitly denied).
 * - Data validation is minimized to only essential checks (e.g., matching user ID).
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The rules assume no denormalization. If more complex access control is
 * required, consider adding fields like `ownerId` to documents and using
 * those fields in the rules.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * No segregation of private and public data is implemented in this initial
 * ruleset. Consider separate collections (e.g., `/users/{userId}/drafts` vs.
 * `/published`) for more complex scenarios.
