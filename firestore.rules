/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Attendance Tracker application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset provides completely open access to all data for prototyping purposes.
 * In a production application, this would be heavily restricted to enforce data ownership and access control.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /attendance_points/{pointId}: Stores attendance records, openly accessible.
 * - /employees/{employeeId}: Stores employee records, openly accessible.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - All read and write operations are currently allowed without authentication.
 * - No data validation is enforced. This is intentional for prototyping and must be added later.
