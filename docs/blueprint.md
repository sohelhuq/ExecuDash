# **App Name**: ExecuDash

## Core Features:

- Data Aggregation: Aggregate and display key performance indicators (KPIs) from all business units within the Shetue Group, providing a holistic view of the conglomerate's performance.
- Natural Language Query Interface: Enable users to query the system and retrieve data using natural language commands in both English and Bangla. The system will parse the queries, extract relevant information, and fetch the corresponding data.
- Executive Dashboard Configuration: Allow users to customize the dashboard by adding, removing, or rearranging widgets, changing chart visualizations (line, bar, area, table, KPI), and creating custom views tailored to their specific needs.
- Automated Alerting System: Implement an alerting system that monitors key metrics and sends notifications (via Telegram, email, SMS, WhatsApp) when predefined conditions are met, such as low fuel stock or pump downtime. The AI tool will analyze historical data and user preferences to suggest optimal alert thresholds.
- Trend Analysis and Forecasting: Utilize AI to analyze historical data and identify trends, patterns, and anomalies in the data. This feature will provide users with insights into past performance and enable them to make informed decisions about the future. This is a tool that suggests optimal actions, based on predicted results.
- Cross-Lingual Support: Enable users to interact with the application in either English or Bangla. All system prompts, follow-up questions, and notifications will be displayed in the user's preferred language, while ensuring that the underlying data and entities remain consistent.
- User Authentication and Authorization: Secure the application by implementing user authentication and authorization mechanisms to restrict access to sensitive data and features based on user roles and permissions.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#3F51B5) to convey professionalism, trustworthiness, and a tech-forward approach.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F2F5), a neutral backdrop that keeps the focus on the data visualizations.
- Accent color: Soft amber (#FFB300), used sparingly to draw attention to key metrics or calls to action without overwhelming the user.
- Body font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, will provide a modern and objective look. This font is suitable for headlines and body text.
- Use clean, minimalist icons to represent different business units, metrics, and actions, enhancing usability and scannability.
- Implement a responsive, grid-based layout to ensure the dashboard adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices, maintaining a consistent and user-friendly experience.
- Incorporate subtle animations and transitions to provide visual feedback to user interactions, creating a polished and engaging experience.
